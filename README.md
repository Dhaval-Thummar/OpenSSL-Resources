# OpenSSL-Resources

For all its warts, OpenSSL is one of the most successful and most important open source
projects. It’s successful because it’s so widely used; it’s important because the security of large
parts of the Internet infrastructure relies on it. The project consists of a high-performance
implementation of key cryptographic algorithms, a complete SSL/TLS and PKI stack, and a
command-line toolkit.
