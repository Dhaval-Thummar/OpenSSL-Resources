# OpenSSL-Resources

OpenSSL is an open source project that consists of a cryptographic library and an SSL/TLS
toolkit. From the project’s web site:
The OpenSSL Project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust, commer-
cial-grade, full-featured, and Open Source toolkit implementing the Secure
Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols as well as a
full-strength general purpose cryptography library. The project is managed by a
worldwide community of volunteers that use the Internet to communicate, plan,
and develop the OpenSSL toolkit and its related documentation.

For all its warts, OpenSSL is one of the most successful and most important open source
projects. It’s successful because it’s so widely used; it’s important because the security of large
parts of the Internet infrastructure relies on it. The project consists of a high-performance
implementation of key cryptographic algorithms, a complete SSL/TLS and PKI stack, and a
command-line toolkit.
