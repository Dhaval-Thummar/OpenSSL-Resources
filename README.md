## OpenSSL

- OpenSSL is an open source project that consists of a cryptographic library and an SSL/TLS toolkit

- OpenSSL is a general purpose cryptography library that provides an open source implementation of the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols.

- The library includes tools for generating RSA private keys and Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs), checksums, managing certificates and performing encryption/decryption. 

- OpenSSL is written in C, but wrappers are available for a wide variety of computer languages.

As per OpenSSL projectâ€™s web site:

> The OpenSSL Project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured, and Open Source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols as well as a full-strength general purpose cryptography library. The project is managed by a worldwide community of volunteers that use the Internet to communicate, plan,
and develop the OpenSSL toolkit and its related documentation

**History**

> The code initially began its life in 1995 under the name SSLeay, 1 when it was developed by Eric A. Young and Tim J. Hudson. The OpenSSL project was born in the last days of 1998, when Eric and Tim stopped their work on SSLeay to work on a commercial SSL/TLS toolkit called BSAFE SSL-C at RSA Australia.
